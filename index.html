      </h3>
      <p style="background-color:#f5f7b2; color:#000000;"> Type 2 diabetes is a condition in which the body becomes resistant to insulin, the hormone produced by the pancreas that lowers blood sugar levels. Combining both exercise and nutrition is ideal for individuals with type 2 diabetes.

      <h4 style="background-color:#f5f7b2; color:red;"> The relationship between sitting disease and type 2 diabetes:
      </h4>
      <p style="background-color:#f5f7b2; color:#000000;"> It is estimated that 422 million people worldwide suffer from diabetes, and this number is expected to rise to 642 million (~ 10% of the population) by 2040. In addition, it is estimated that 1 in 15 people have the disorder Diabetes has continued to develop into type 2 diabetes. Epidemiological evidence suggests that time spent in sedentary behaviors (a lot of sitting) is associated with an increased risk of developing type 2 diabetes. 
      An inactive lifestyle (sitting sickness) is one of the main risk factors for type 2 diabetes. The link may be obesity associated with being less active; Obesity affects glucose tolerance. Physical activity helps use and burn sugar, and increases the body's consumption of glucose (blood sugar) to produce the energy the body needs for vital processes. As a result, you will lower your blood glucose level, thereby reducing the need for diabetes medication.
